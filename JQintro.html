    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO JQUERY</h1>
    <pre>
        -The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
        -jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
        -jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
        -jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

        The jQuery library contains the following features:
        
        HTML/DOM manipulation
        CSS manipulation
        HTML event methods
        Effects and animations
        AJAX
        Utilities

        Why jQuery?

        -There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

        -Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

                Google
                Microsoft
                IBM
                Netflix
        -The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. 
        -jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.

        Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages:

        -There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

        -Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
        -Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
        
        Downloading jQuery:

        -There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

            Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
            Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)

            Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

        -The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file,
         and you reference it with the HTML script tag (notice that the script tag should be inside the head section)
        
        -Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it.

    <h1>JQUERY SYNTAX</h1>
    <pre>
        jQuery Syntax
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

Examples:

$(this).hide() - hides the current element.

$("p").hide() - hides all paragraph elements.

$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

The Document Ready Event
All jQuery method sare inside a document ready event:
$(document).ready(function(){

    // jQuery methods go here...
  
  });

  This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

  It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.
  
  Here are some examples of actions that can fail if methods are run before the document is fully loaded:
  
  Trying to hide an element that is not created yet
  Trying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet

  The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the document ready event:

  $(function(){

    // jQuery methods go here...
  
  });

    </pre>

       <h1>AUTOCOMPLETE</h1>
       <pre>
        Auto completion is a mechanism frequently used in modern websites to provide the user with a list of suggestions for the beginning of the word,
        which he/she has typed in a text box.
        
        The user can then select an item from the list, which will be displayed in the input field.
        
        This feature prevents the user from having to enter an entire word or a set of words.

        JQueryUI provides an autocomplete widget — a control that acts a lot like a select dropdown, 
        but filters the choices to present only those that match what the user is typing into a control. 
        
        jQueryUI provides the autocomplete() method to create a list of suggestions below the input field and adds new CSS classes to the elements concerned to give them the appropriate style.
       
        Syntax
            $(selector, context).autocomplete (options);
    
    </pre>
      <!-- HTML --> 
      <div class = "ui-widget">
         <p><em>Enter word or letter </em></p>
         <label for = "automplete-1">Tags: </label>
         <input id = "automplete-1">
